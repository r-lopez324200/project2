		<td class="column1"><h2>Inequality Between Girls and Boys</h2>
			<br>
			<h4>Girls have the least access to education, and they make up more than 54% of the world's non-schooled poopulation.</h4>
			<h4>This problem occurs mostly in the Arab States, Southern and Western Asia, and central Asia. This occurs mostly in these areas due to cultural and traditional priviledged treatment better given to boys/men. Typically, girls are known to just work in the family home where boys are the ones to go to school and receive at least some education.</h4>
			<h4>Even though many developing countries congratulate themselves for reducing inequality between boys and girls for education, there is so much more effort still needed for children to receive a universal primary education.</h4>
		</td>
		<td class="column2"><h2>Poverty</h2>
			<br>
			<h4>In many developed or developing countries, children don't have acces to basic education, due to cultural identity, sex, etc.</h4>
			<h4>In Mexico, about 18% of the country lives in extreme poverty. Because of this, there are more poor communities, absences, school dropout rates and grade repetition are serious problems for children. According to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), Mexico has one of the lowest school enrollment rates from students between the ages of 15 and 19 years. Because of this, many children are being driven toward finding a job rather than getting an education.</h4>

		<td class="column3"><h2>The Most Affected Regions on Earth</h2>
			<h4>Due to mostly poverty, more than 72 million children around the world are unschooled.</h4>
			<br>
			<h3>Sub-Saharan Africa:</h3> <h4>32 million elementary school aged students</h4>
			<h3>Central and Eastern Asia:</h3> <h4>27 million children</h4>
